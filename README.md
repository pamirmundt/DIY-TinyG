# DIY TinyG
## DIY TinyG with Original Dimensions
This version has the original board dimensions and connector positions. 1206 package is selected for resistors and caps for easy hand soldering. Other than board dimensions and connector positions, rest of the components' positions are not exact.

## DIY TinyG with Optimised Dimensions (100x100mm)
This version does **not** have the original board dimensions and connector positions. There is a relatively big price difference between *105x101mm* and *100x100mm* board dimensions at Seeed, OSH, JLCPCB and etc. So this version is a bit trimmed.
